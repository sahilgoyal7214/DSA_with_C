# PROBLEM STATEMENT 1
Write a C program to sort an array of integers using the Merge Sort algorithm. However, the program should implement an optimized version of Merge Sort that skips the merge step if the two subarrays are already sorted in ascending order. The program should also keep track of the number of comparisons performed during the sorting process.  
# Requirements:
•	The program should prompt the user to enter the size of the array (maximum size: 100) and the elements of the array.  
•	The program should implement the Merge Sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order.  
•	If the program detects that the two subarrays in the merge step are already sorted in ascending order, it should skip the merge step for that subarray.  
•	The program should keep track of the number of comparisons performed during the sorting process and print the total number of comparisons at the end.  
•	After sorting, the program should print the sorted array.
