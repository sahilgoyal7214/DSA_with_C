# PROBLEM STATEMENT 2

Do a Time Complexity Comparison on the Code (A), when implemented using Quick Sort with Merge Sort on random data (10000).  
# Requirements:  
•	Generates an array of Random Integer and save it in arr[].  
•	Copy the content of arr[] into arr1[], arr2[], arr3[].  
•	performs Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort on the array, and measures the execution time of each algorithm. The time taken for each sorting  
•	Use #include<time.h> header file, and its library clock() to capture the current time.  
#### Use following syntax : 
``` bash
clock_t start = clock();
// write your code or call process
clock_t end = clock();
//calculate the time difference as
double time_taken = ((double)(end - start)) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
  ```
