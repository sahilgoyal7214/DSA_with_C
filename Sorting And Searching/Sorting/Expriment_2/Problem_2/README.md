# PROBLEM STATEMENT 2

Write a C program that implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in descending order. However, there is a catch. The program should terminate the sorting process early if it detects that the array is already sorted in descending order. In other words, if the array is already in descending order, the program should stop the sorting process and print the sorted array.

## Requirements:
-	The program should prompt the user to enter the size of the array (maximum size: 100) and the elements of the array.  
-	The program should implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the array in descending order.  
-	If the program detects that the array is already sorted in descending order during the sorting process, it should terminate the sorting process and print the sorted array.  
-	If the array is not already sorted, the program should continue sorting until the entire array is sorted in descending order.  
-	After sorting, the program should print the sorted array.
