# Sorting and Searching Algorithms


Welcome to the "Sorting and Searching Algorithms" subcategory of the DSA Problems Repository! This subcategory focuses on problems related to sorting and searching algorithms. It is an essential area of study for any computer scientist or programmer, as these algorithms are widely used to efficiently organize and retrieve data.

## Problem List

The following problems are included in this subcategory:

1. **Linear Search:** Implement the Linear Search algorithm to find a target element in an unsorted array.

2. **Binary Search:** Implement the Binary Search algorithm to find a target element in a sorted array.

3. **Insertion Sort:** Implement the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

4. **Merge Sort:** Implement the Merge Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

5. **Quick Sort:** Implement the Quick Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

6. **Bubble Sort:** Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

7. **Selection Sort:** Implement the Selection Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

## Getting Started

To get started with the problems in this subcategory, follow these steps:

1. Clone the DSA Problems Repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/sahilgoyal7214/DSA_with_C.git`.
2. Navigate to the "Sorting and Searching Algorithms" subcategory directory.
3. Choose a problem you want to work on and open its corresponding README.md file.
4. Read the problem description and input-output format carefully.
5. Implement your solution in a programming language of your choice.
6. Test your solution with various test cases to validate its correctness.
