Write a C program to find the index of a target word in a sorted array of words. The
array is sorted in lexicographic (dictionary) order. Your program should perform a binary search to find the index of the target word in the array, if it exists.   
If the target word is not present in the array, your program should return -1.  

Write a function  int binarySearchWords(char* words[], int size, char* target)  that takes the
following parameters:  
- words: An array of strings representing the sorted words.  
- size: The number of elements in the array.
- target: The target word to search for.
The function should return the index of the target word in the array, or -1 if it is not found.
