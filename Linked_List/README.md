# Linked List Implementations

This folder contains implementations of various types of linked lists in C . Linked lists are fundamental data structures that consist of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

## Types of Linked Lists

### 1. Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which each node points to the next node in the sequence.



### 2. Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but each node also has a reference to the previous node.


### 3. Circular Linked List

In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.
